# HorizonExtensions
These are the list of Extensions I had made for AI2 builders. You just have to follow the instructions given and the Extensions will directely downloaded to your laptop

For downloading all the extension just open you PowerShell and then Enter these commands
```
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
```
```
iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Horizon3833/HorizonExtensions/master/script/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```
The files will be downloaded in the desktop with folder name "HorizonExtensions" and then you can open it and cd inside "Extensions" There you'll get all the extensions

**Thank You**
